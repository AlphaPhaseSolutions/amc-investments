    AMC partners with top sponsors to identify investments in select markets and product spaces. In other words, AMC defines the geographic locations and product types that it wants to invest in, and then finds the best partners to joint venture within those market spaces.

    AMC targets transactions that are too small for institutional investors but above the point at which high net worth individuals can operate with AMC’s level of efficiency. In doing so, AMC is able to provide sponsors with ready access to capital while also providing AMC investors access to larger transactions that they otherwise could never invest in.

    AMC has never failed to close on a transaction that underwrote as it was originally presented.
